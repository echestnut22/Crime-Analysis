# Crime-Analysis-

TODO

High Priority:

- Set up AWS and import datasets
- Clean current datasets (remove irrelevant data, remove rows that have NaNs in important columns etc.)

Medium Priority:
- Find another city with good data on public goods, housing, access to transportation and other public services etc. as well as crime data to eventually be used for our prediction model

Lower priority:
- Find more Chicago socioeconomic datasets
- From my understanding, it will be a lot simpler for a machine learning model to digest numerical data, so we should at some assign point assign categories to number values (ie. Assault is 0, Theft is 1, Narcotics is 2, etc.). This is called label encoding. There is also one-hot encoding, a different type of encoding to look into. - Eric
