High Priority:

- Set up AWS and import datasets
- Clean current datasets (remove irrelevant data, remove rows that have NaNs in important columns etc.)

Medium Priority:
- Find another city with good data on public goods, housing, access to transportation and other public services etc. as well as crime data to eventually be used for our prediction model

Lower priority:
- Find more Chicago socioeconomic datasets
