# Crime-Analysis-

TODO

High Priority:

- Finish aggregating and cleaning data. Upload to database
- Start statistical EDA once all datasets can be joined (regression to start looking for relationships with crime)

Medium Priority:
- Find another city with good data on public goods, housing, access to transportation and other public services etc. as well as crime data to eventually be used for our prediction model

Lower priority:
- Find more Chicago socioeconomic datasets
- From my understanding, it will be a lot simpler for a machine learning model to digest numerical data, so we should at some assign point assign categories to number values (ie. Assault is 0, Theft is 1, Narcotics is 2, etc.). This is called label encoding. There is also one-hot encoding, a different type of encoding to look into. - Eric
